**A**utomated **C**ommunity **D**etection of **C**ell Populations in Python  

This repo contains the current Python implementation of ACDC, an optimization-based framework to automatize clustering of cell populations from scRNA-seq data using community detection algorithms. 
```acdc_py``` is currently **under development** and new functionalities will be released, following completion and benchmarking. 
```acdc_py``` is deployed as a Python package and fully compatible with ```Scanpy```.

- Several graph-based clustering algorithms are available within ```acdc_py```, including Leiden and Louvain. 
- 2 optimization routines for parameter tuning are available, Grid Search and(generalized) Simulated Annealing.
- Optimization variables include the number of nearest neighbors, *k*, resolution, *res*, and the number of principal components, *PCs*.
- Several objective functions are available, including the Silhouette Score (default).


New releases will expand functionalities to new features, including the possibility to iteratively sub-cluster cell populations to find fine grain and biologically meaningful clustering solutions.

STAY TUNED FOR UPDATES AND NOVEL DEVELOPMENTS!🤘🏾
```

**Please, be aware that while this project is "work in progress" and outcomes are continuously benchmarked, cross-platform compability might not yet be guaranteed.
